# folder-finder
Little app in Electron to find a folder in disk. I made this app many years ago, but never uploaded it. Now I rebuilt it a little.

Essentially, it searches for a folder, enable disk navigation, open a file or a folder,
and has some functions like favorites and configuration to be a little complete.

It is a simple but good example of an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app.
